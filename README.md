## Description

This repository is for an application that is built using WebPack and allows users to edit and save text. The application uses caching and a client hosted indexDB to save assets so that if the user is offline the application still runs. Additionally, the user is able to download the application and run it a localized application independent of the browser. The motivation for creating this application was to practice the principles of creating a progressive web application and gain an understanding of the techniques and strategies used to develop such applications. From a developers perspective, I learned a great deal in understanding how to cache assets on the clients browser and how to create a progressive web application using WebPack. I also gained a clearer understanding of WebPack and its vital applications in performance of an application. 

## Installation

In order to install this application, you must first click the link to the landing page. You can find that page here >>> [Landing Page](https://jate-text-editor-app239558-7d971bc2a30b.herokuapp.com/). Then at the top of your browser you will see down arrow near the end of your url bar. Clicking this icon will allow you to install the application outside of the browser and freely use it. 

## Usage

In order to use this project, first you will need to go to the landing page. Click Here >> to go to the landing page [Landing Page](https://jate-text-editor-app239558-7d971bc2a30b.herokuapp.com/). From here, you will see the header in text format 'JATE'. You can type anything you want in the text editor and hit the refresh button. You will notice that the text is saved on the page. You can also follow the install steps above to install the application. Another thing to note is that you can also use the application in an offline mode since the text that you type will be stored in a newly created indexDB on your client browser. When you return online the service worker will connect to the server and update any changes that were made. 

## Credits
